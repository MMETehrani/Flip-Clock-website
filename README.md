### Flip Clock Website ⏰

Hey there!  
One day I was thinking, "What if there was a website that purely focused on showing the time?" I thought it would be fun! 🤩  
So, I got to work and built my favorite clock in the form of a website. And here we are: **Flip Clock Website**!  

This digital clock not only tells you the time, but it also gives you a cool, visually engaging experience of time.

### Features ✨

- **Theme Switcher:** Easily toggle between dark and light themes to match your vibe.  
- **12/24 Hour Display:** Switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats with a single click.  
- **Full-Screen Mode:** Want to dedicate the whole screen to the clock? Just hit the fullscreen button.  
- **Smooth Animations:** Time transitions with awesome flip animations that make checking the time more fun!
